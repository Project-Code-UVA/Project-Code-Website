        <h2>Mission statement:</h2> 
        <p>Project Code aims to empower UVA students by emphasizing a problem-solving process through real-life applications of computer science. Connecting passionate individuals with various skills and similar interests presents a high priority. Numerous students have never attempted a CS project before, and we hope to offer them the opportunity to prepare for life outside of UVA. These projects will provide students with the necessary skills and a creative outlet.</p>

        <h3>Tempo</h3>
        <p>Tempo is a free music and podcast-sharing app for iOS. Anyone will be able to log into their music/podcast platform (Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Youtube, Apple Podcasts, etc.) and upload their favorite songs, playlists, artists, albums, and podcasts to Tempo, for sharing with followers and select friends. Tempo users will also be able to view, comment, like, collaborate, and discover content shared by friends, across platforms. Tempo will recognize favored content, like a popular playlist, for example, with gold, platinum, or diamond status. One of our goals with Tempo will be to promote unknown artists. In addition, artists will be able to pay a monthly subscription to share content through personalized advertisements. While streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music are well-known for streaming music, Tempo will be more akin to a social media platform. Users will have access to statistics on their listening trends, interests, and compatibility with other users.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market Bot</h3>
        <p>The Stock Market Bot will focus on finding and capitalizing on patterns in candlestick charts and combining them with the existing news sentiment analysis to create a unique algorithm.</p>
        <h3>Hoos Available</h3>
        <p>A website that provides information about UVA professors' office hours, office locations with corresponding maps, and other contact information with a search engine and sorting function allowing users to look up specific details, such as professors' bios, ongoing research, and classes taught. The goal of Hoos Available is to encourage and support students to build networks with the professors on the grounds, including professors they are not taking classes with.</p>
        <h3>Peer-To-Peer File Sharing</h3>
        <p>A peer-to-peer file transfer and clipboard sharing application that works on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Through this project, you will have the chance to work on decentralized networking, cloud computing, databasing, and software development.</p>
